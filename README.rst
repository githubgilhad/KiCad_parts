Here are some parts for KiCad

Mainly for creating 3D models for inclusion in other projects. Electrically it usually does not make sense, it is just for looks.

**CP2102** is small USB -- UART module, which can be used as is.

**SD card** is module for SD cards, there is hack so it does not disturb other SPI devices - see README in this directory
